/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC9.wav,451408,well i think what happened is i felt like i had to do everything now 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC14.wav,218352,i have this galloping gait 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC16.wav,306988,so this will be my last marathon 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC5.wav,207160,like i had a stroke 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC18.wav,215932,you know i was reading about it and 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC6.wav,186992,no i didn't 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC4.wav,215432,what's wrong with you then 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC17.wav,312072,i mean i really know nothing about a foundation till i got diagnosed and then 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC12.wav,251412,training is not going well 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/JC_ori/JC2.wav,320296,like my right leg just didn't keep up with the left leg 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ19.wav,311756,the cure may seem elusive but we're not giving up 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ7.wav,203540,it destroyed me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ22.wav,323620,we may each have our own individual parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ2.wav,519000,i soon learned that each patient has their own version of parkinson's their own story to tell 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ16.wav,248048,acceptance doesn't mean resignation 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ8.wav,273224,and you you dream on your way 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ21.wav,299844,we've resolved to fight this disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ18.wav,382704,there are over one million people living with parkinson's in the united states 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ9.wav,414456,so much of what you do is precise and about balance 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ17.wav,364348,you can accept it and then endeavor to change it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ13.wav,300380,if you're symptomatic it's reflective of some kind of flaw 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/MJ_ori/MJ4.wav,307612,so how was the reaction of your family 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK8.wav,508276,this was the first out of eight siblings that had really asked me about it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK9.wav,407284,and because i was the swimmer of the family 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK10.wav,301040,i was went to college on a scholarship 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK7.wav,289412,my sister started asking me questions 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK4.wav,209380,why me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK3.wav,367052,that just came across me like where did this come from 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK13.wav,339492,i was given this and i was given it for a reason 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK12.wav,426328,i guess it took me a few years to say okay 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK5.wav,359544,in our family we always swept things under the rug 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/SK_ori/SK6.wav,529696,after you would come out with an article about going public with it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TP_ori/TP3.wav,309812,and sooner or later there wouldn't the hand wouldn't move 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TP_ori/TP6.wav,235268,and the answers are elusive 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TP_ori/TP2.wav,359664,and i would start to note the letters would get smaller and smaller 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG20.wav,334516,when you're playing and you have injuries you know that you can recover from it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG24.wav,200788,and i had to lose that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG6.wav,237648,it's the only thing i knew about it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG32.wav,384044,this you know even though it's tremoring or maybe it's something else 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG21.wav,222916,you know that you can recover from it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG19.wav,309252,and then i had and you know a marriage 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG31.wav,248092,sometimes i convinced myself didn't man 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG40.wav,217476,and i can fix it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG3.wav,221792,and finally i was diagnosed 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG12.wav,289180,the number one thing that the doctors tell you is don't stress out 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG25.wav,419628,because i really missed out on being able to spend some good time with these guys over the past few years 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG11.wav,445324,and i didn't directly tell her what the story was 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG23.wav,285772,if there's something that you can't fix 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG22.wav,254112,you'll be alright you'll be back on the court 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG18.wav,228608,i had depression 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG29.wav,248312,i don't know if this happened with you 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG14.wav,236116,you know that that's impossible 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG30.wav,287320,but sometimes i think i don't have it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG1.wav,280016,i had a really strong hand tremor 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG28.wav,478028,for me for me it has it just it all at once to come and say okay i accepted 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG37.wav,280412,i'm brian grant i'm not brian the player you know 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG26.wav,261488,because i was too nervous to go into a locker room 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS4.wav,229376,it wasn't there anymore 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS9.wav,390560,and now it's like it's rather hard to keep that flowing 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS6.wav,308080,i wish we could somehow sleepwalk 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS1.wav,630864,i had noticed um a few years prior that i wasn't smelling things as clearly 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS3.wav,428344,but then it came to a point where the thing that stops it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS15.wav,491548,and the financing to use their minds to to zero in on the problem 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS2.wav,577288,and i started off just kind of noticing a kind of a kink in my arm before i could just stop it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS13.wav,444200,you know what you're doing is just like that it's the it's so hero 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS14.wav,448412,it's so amazing you know to be able to get people the tools
