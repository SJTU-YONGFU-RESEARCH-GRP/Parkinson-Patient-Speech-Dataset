/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG41.wav,290848,i can do this alone and now i know that i can't 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG6.wav,237648,it's the only thing i knew about it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG15.wav,248192,i mean you don't get to decide it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG36.wav,327676,i don't need to be in the nba i don't need to be that player 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG4.wav,419164,and i remember when you came out and told the world that you had parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG8.wav,273328,so i i kept it to myself in my first year 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG33.wav,284908,i you know my mind plays tricks on me sometimes 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG23.wav,285772,if there's something that you can't fix 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG30.wav,287320,but sometimes i think i don't have it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG1.wav,280016,i had a really strong hand tremor 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG35.wav,245716,i finally let the nba go 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG32.wav,384044,this you know even though it's tremoring or maybe it's something else 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG11.wav,445324,and i didn't directly tell her what the story was 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG21.wav,222916,you know that you can recover from it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG37.wav,280412,i'm brian grant i'm not brian the player you know 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG25.wav,419628,because i really missed out on being able to spend some good time with these guys over the past few years 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG28.wav,478028,for me for me it has it just it all at once to come and say okay i accepted 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG12.wav,289180,the number one thing that the doctors tell you is don't stress out 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG39.wav,432864,and that's what i've learned to do is to let people come and help with before i was all about me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG13.wav,230760,how can you tell me not to stress out 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG16.wav,359196,the moment you you know have parkinson's whether you're going through family issues 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG3.wav,221792,and finally i was diagnosed 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG5.wav,347920,i just thought it was just a disease that made you shake 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG10.wav,251084,in your mind you tend to think that you're weak 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG27.wav,325380,because i didn't want the young guy seeing my hand shake 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG9.wav,331408,and i dropped hints and i brought up alerts 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG24.wav,200788,and i had to lose that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG14.wav,236116,you know that that's impossible 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG40.wav,217476,and i can fix it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG31.wav,248092,sometimes i convinced myself didn't man 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG18.wav,228608,i had depression 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG22.wav,254112,you'll be alright you'll be back on the court 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG19.wav,309252,and then i had and you know a marriage 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG42.wav,300032,and i know that i do have to let these people come and help 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG20.wav,334516,when you're playing and you have injuries you know that you can recover from it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG26.wav,261488,because i was too nervous to go into a locker room 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG7.wav,478496,well i prepared my wife first and wanted her to become comfortable with it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/BG_ori/BG29.wav,248312,i don't know if this happened with you
