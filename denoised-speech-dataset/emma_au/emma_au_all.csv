/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC123.wav,223152,and seriously what is the worst that can happen 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC40.wav,191002,and sometimes that ceiling is there because you've put it there 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC71.wav,311828,because i decided there wasn't enough books about the subject written from a younger person's perspective 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC20.wav,384236,they were always incredibly accepting of me and who i was and what i brought to the world 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC69.wav,138178,if you find him laterhe will tell you some more 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC15.wav,486804,confident in my own little way confident among my friends confident in situation i was comfortable in 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC121.wav,342968,i'm going to end this speech in a way that shows confidence to me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC21.wav,119842,just as they were with each other 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC45.wav,111850,and i wanted more than that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC60.wav,403226,but it's also on a more granular level putting yourself in really stupid situations 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC30.wav,372736,when my diagnosis of parkinson's came it was a little bit of a shock 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC18.wav,165566,but i'd come off as a little timid mouse afterwards 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC6.wav,416890,these two very soft focus lovelies got married and decided they wanted to have children 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC61.wav,280830,and i've got tons of examples of things i've done that are ridiculous 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC96.wav,112146,i'm on day fifty five 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC114.wav,328648,and it makes you think i can try some other things and see what happens 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC73.wav,210982,and i knew the exact date that i wanted my book launch to be 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC35.wav,128302,you're chucked into a box 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC68.wav,83746,because there're tons 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC62.wav,368210,i think it's having unbelievable faith in yourself and knowing that it doesn't matter if you fail 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC3.wav,288818,and four years ago the age of twenty ninei was diagnosed with parkinson's disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC22.wav,89462,there were such different people 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC12.wav,77000,she was very timid 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC2.wav,75942,my name is emma 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC32.wav,290198,i'm not an older man so i wasn't expecting it to be parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC65.wav,125896,because i've not worried too much 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC116.wav,286146,and actually it being okay to fail it not mattering at all 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC1.wav,208526,firstly i would say you've got to have confidence to wear trousers like this 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC54.wav,264052,but i was going to work and actually being myself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC112.wav,99652,i can get parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC80.wav,84510,but it worked 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC102.wav,95596,and i said yes 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC75.wav,166426,you know you can tell i like a party because i like a secret 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC41.wav,186264,and the expectations for you are so much lower 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC44.wav,211390,just getting on with your lifeyou're inspirational for doing that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC37.wav,131358,and a ceiling is put in place 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC101.wav,455352,because last year a woman who i don't know invited me to go on a three hundred ton boat with her for a week 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC113.wav,78208,done that tick 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC90.wav,135918,having never really made a video 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC94.wav,145192,he said i managed thirty days 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC47.wav,350806,and luckily my friends and my family expected the same with me too 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC57.wav,205914,and i think now looking backthat thing was confidence 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC77.wav,188886,confidence or foolishness is a really fine line 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC55.wav,190432,and i was seeing colour in myself that i really liked 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC119.wav,166348,because i never would have known the measure of myself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC23.wav,141046,and they looked at each other then they loved each other 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC82.wav,153230,it was that close but it worked 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC76.wav,528200,and i booked my venuesent out the facebook invitewrote a press release 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC24.wav,169168,and they loved me for being a mix of the two of them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC93.wav,78170,he was a videographer 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC19.wav,177954,but they never pushed me to be anything more than that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC118.wav,255892,and so i guess in a strange way i'm grateful to parkinson's for doing that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC103.wav,186986,and i'm still aliveso my parents taught me a lot 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC115.wav,429962,and so my parents gave me this great basis to build onof love and support 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC4.wav,181902,that's the story i've probably told many times 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC79.wav,163586,because she's sensible about things like this 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC74.wav,98770,i wanted a big party 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC64.wav,118566,the amount of things that have gone right for me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC105.wav,207052,but it was an incredible experience and one that i'm really proud of 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC7.wav,173002,they would become my parentsned and lanny 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC70.wav,238150,the first one being i decided to write a book about parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC53.wav,220514,and i was waking up each dayand not just getting up 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC5.wav,264978,the story i want to tell today started thirty years prior to that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC91.wav,150698,and actually having the attention span of an ant 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC95.wav,113920,you won't get further than that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC38.wav,148522,and it's very difficult to push past that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC86.wav,180536,i think i can probably tell my story better that way 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC10.wav,125294,my mom was quite timid at this stage 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC89.wav,142922,having never used youtube before 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC43.wav,297846,just getting up or going into workyou're inspirational for doing that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC83.wav,132834,and the problem is when things work like that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC56.wav,131314,there was something different about me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC120.wav,196132,because i am the complete mix of my parents 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC52.wav,134322,and i was thriving 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC50.wav,251502,and they laughed at me and joked with me in the same way they used to before 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC17.wav,121186,you'd put me on a stage and i'd be confident 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC46.wav,374786,i wanted to push past that and actually live an exciting life 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC39.wav,113130,you have to really really want to 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC33.wav,146436,and when you're diagnosed with something longterm 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC63.wav,358350,and if you think you're going to fail and you don't worry about failing you're more likely to succeed to be honest 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC100.wav,110120,but i have a really good excuse 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC31.wav,103326,i'm not going to lie to you 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC25.wav,583752,and so i grew up in a situation feeling incredibly supportiveincredibly cared for 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC78.wav,126882,and my mum was having quittance bless her 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC29.wav,640484,until i became a small child all the way through to my teenage years right up until the end of my twentys 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC48.wav,107646,they didn't put me in a box 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC81.wav,217844,i mean my books arrived the day before my book launch 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC109.wav,218492,it just took me that bit longer to find it in myself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC97.wav,168894,confidence is also quite close to being smug i think 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC98.wav,313204,so i've cheated slightly on the last week of the blog project 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC36.wav,108550,and there's a label put onto it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC107.wav,329868,where there are thousands more is blind faith in myself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC9.wav,252830,and i was given something by thema little bit of both of them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC8.wav,308026,and four years after thisi was born into the world yellow and tiny 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC28.wav,158866,and i carried on much in the same way 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC14.wav,132472,and i became a little bit of both of them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC92.wav,131446,and a friend of mine said to me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC99.wav,203878,because i've bunched five days into one video 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC67.wav,210344,my boyfriend will be somewhere in this audience thinking oh just a few 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC27.wav,242078,at this stagei never really knew how important this would be for the rest of my life 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC88.wav,181826,where i upload a video every day to youtube 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC104.wav,133496,they probably didn't teach me stranger danger 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC49.wav,188682,they said you're the same emma 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC34.wav,110510,when you're diagnosed with anything 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC111.wav,91748,what's the worst that can happen 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC16.wav,156220,i was into drama in a big way 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC72.wav,166274,and i'd not really done any writing before 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC66.wav,236614,i'll give you some examples of stupid things i've done the last couple of years 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC51.wav,200862,and i suddenly realized that i was coping 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC11.wav,160096,you can tell by the very sweet expression on her face 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC26.wav,177098,and as if it was okay to be me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC85.wav,375350,so on a whim i thoughti'd like to share my story in video form 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC84.wav,130268,you think it might work again 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC87.wav,334458,so i embarked on a three hundred and sixty five day video blog project 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC13.wav,440770,and my dad was a bit of a hama confident person that would go into any room and tell a story and command a stage 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC58.wav,343498,because to me confidence is getting up in the morning 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC42.wav,179106,because you're expecting less of yourself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC108.wav,210392,something that my parents have always had in me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC117.wav,197748,but it took parkinson's to draw it out from me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC110.wav,209932,you start saying to yourself what's the worst that can happen 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC59.wav,619516,being able to get up get dressedgo to work live a fairly normal lifeand really hit the world head on 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC122.wav,217660,as a girl with parkinson's i am going to juggle 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/IC1111/IC106.wav,239464,and i think the thing that runs through these three examples 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP2.wav,431694,and just under four years agoat the age of twenty ninei was diagnosed with parkinson's disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP154.wav,110834,you may not have been there for them in the past 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP156.wav,396686,and actually having a support network when something bad's happening or when good stuff is happening is really really incredibly important 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP215.wav,141866,perhaps it might seem a little bit frightening 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP185.wav,524206,i would say i never really appreciated steady hands a firm handshakebeing able to talk clearly 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP196.wav,247122,being able to stand up in front of a room of peoplefills me with so much joy and happiness 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP82.wav,160894,it's okay to say you are having a shit day 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP87.wav,199578,and ultimately by saying to peoplei'm having a terrible day 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP166.wav,151382,i've been laughing in my head at the name trump 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP170.wav,256626,it's kind of running on the grass when you're not supposed to and doing stupid things 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP210.wav,153522,i never did charity worki never did anything like that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP208.wav,129242,maybe not be such a narcissist 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP14.wav,166086,it's definitely rare for twenty nineyearold women to get it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP66.wav,121650,don't look for happiness 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP24.wav,163534,i was never thinking anything more serious 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP216.wav,133242,if you're in london and you see someone shaking 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP76.wav,128846,probably everyone's told you it a thousand times 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP28.wav,191874,this was eventually my diagnosis date 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP124.wav,264134,and actually by being more tolerant of othersit makes you happier in yourself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP172.wav,187182,when suddenly you're dealt something that's really massive 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP93.wav,91330,i'm doing everyone a misjustice 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP7.wav,275110,i want to talk to you about what parkinson's has taught me during that time 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP80.wav,122930,the people around you will be happier as well 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP109.wav,112874,i would encourage other people to do the same 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP158.wav,238682,it's also really important to make sure you have a team around you that are there cheering you on 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP44.wav,142574,and i think that's because i put a slant on it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP240.wav,71806,thank you 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP189.wav,179994,but appreciate the things that you take for granted 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP105.wav,77290,what's the worst that could happen 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP180.wav,150190,this man's socks here are filling me with great joy 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP227.wav,264214,it's being more tolerant to people and knowing that we're all the same ultimately 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP137.wav,164838,and it's upsetting me slightly 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP233.wav,139158,my chemical make up is still the same 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP151.wav,196870,and i knew that i was sorted and sturdy and supported 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP69.wav,394702,i've looked for it in the form of you know men on white horses carrying you know armour and things like that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP47.wav,176922,but it's also made it easier for me to come to terms with it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP164.wav,165826,wearing trainers definitely helps with that i find 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP36.wav,161142,they were around methey were there for good to help me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP6.wav,101082,thank you 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP86.wav,379630,you have to feel that unhappiness to feel the happiness that you get from a good day and from good things that are happening in your life 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP128.wav,160886,that tolerance comes back to you like a boomerang 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP61.wav,365818,and i'd love to share with you the ways that i've actually found happiness in something as big as parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP236.wav,139730,the way that i feel about the world is completely different 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP149.wav,183806,i knew who my people were before i needed them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP219.wav,160934,you know who i am you see me as a person 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP95.wav,126166,it may be the tenth time i'm telling someone 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP29.wav,119122,it took a little while to get there 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP111.wav,64126,say yes more 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP145.wav,130462,if they're saying they are they're lying 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP143.wav,107530,because no one is happy in heels 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP11.wav,94482,no one is at that age 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP26.wav,309666,and in the weirdest thing that anyone's probably ever thoughti was rooting for parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP77.wav,149454,but if you're happy in yourself and who you are 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP179.wav,213278,as we grow up that kind of gets shaken out of us a little bit 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP108.wav,280694,so because of that i kind of go out and do more than ever before 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP19.wav,172626,you need to get this sortedit's really important' 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP91.wav,182054,but by being honest with peoplethey know how to treat me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP85.wav,281266,if you experience the worst of daysthen you will experience the best of days 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP226.wav,186342,and it's looking into people's eyes when you talk to them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP129.wav,245886,because if you're kind to other peoplepeople are ultimately kind to you 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP235.wav,165386,the way i feel about parkinson's is completely different 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP73.wav,282990,and ultimately you find happiness for a fleeting time with those things 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP48.wav,542106,because ultimatelyi was dealt this big oldugly package of parkinson's and i thought what am i going to do with it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP121.wav,167226,the woman who is letting her child cry in the corner 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP9.wav,211182,so i was diagnosed just under four years ago at the age of twenty nine 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP141.wav,86406,i feel sorry for them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP103.wav,150366,but i do more now than i've ever done before 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP238.wav,130282,because being happy is an incredible thing 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP4.wav,121266,it's you that's where i need to look thank you 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP116.wav,189554,remember that everyone is going through something as well 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP177.wav,138618,they have it set in their minds what they want to do 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP65.wav,453486,these are the ten ways that i've looked to what i have as a situation and actually made it my ownand made it something that i'm happy and proud of 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP182.wav,288070,you know we should wear more colour and be happy and be children at heart 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP40.wav,134918,we were back to normal immediately 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP228.wav,710374,but i have been left with a fantastic parkinson's situation out of my slightly rubbish package that i was given at the beginning 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP136.wav,93438,we're talking like tiny 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP13.wav,241362,if you're a girl under a particular agei think it's quite rare for women to get it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP234.wav,159422,but the way that i see it is completely different 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP186.wav,140726,until those things became more difficult for me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP84.wav,407478,you can base on that old saying which i love which isyou can cover a turd in glitter but it will still be a turd essentially 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP211.wav,306266,being diagnosed made me realise that we have an opportunity to do those things to help people 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP209.wav,237898,but i never had anything that i cared about that passionately before 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP25.wav,663366,and brain scans while i was waiting for them they said to meit could be parkinson's diseaseit could be huntington's diseaseor it could be wilson's disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP162.wav,169090,i mean don't be a grownup 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP68.wav,106458,you're not going to find anything long term 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP35.wav,252002,and it became the day that i knew where my support network was 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP157.wav,88090,it's great to stand on your own 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP213.wav,122890,we can do things to to help people 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP163.wav,189714,run around do what you can you know enjoy yourself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP42.wav,162926,i am just one of those people 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP187.wav,201982,so don't get hung up on the daytoday little things 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP3.wav,302254,i can't control my own slides because my hands are shaking too muchso someone's controlling them for me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP222.wav,134318,but a lot of people don't have that opportunity 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP99.wav,152038,be impatient with yourself and don't settle 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP46.wav,150738,it's definitely easy for people to digest 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP130.wav,106138,it takes sometimes a little while to get there 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP43.wav,229366,but i have been given an opportunity to tell my story countless times 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP200.wav,113530,i mean that's ridiculous 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP41.wav,315934,there's a hundred and twenty seven thousand people currently in the uk living with parkinson's disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP5.wav,213358,i'm going to do this every time i need to control it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP194.wav,290026,but i now appreciate the things that i can do so much more than i ever could before 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP114.wav,197250,but it's definitely a great opportunity to try new things 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP178.wav,120590,they're just going to do it and have fun 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP204.wav,73130,and i fight for others 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP138.wav,313446,wear trainers whenever you can because it's just you know when you're diagnosed with something like parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP90.wav,141654,it's not it's actually incredibly hard 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP120.wav,144582,he might have had a really rubbish day at work 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP217.wav,254542,everyone is kind of aware of what everyone else is doing and keeping an eye on people 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP115.wav,209110,when you suddenly get thrown into a situation where you're dealing with something so new 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP123.wav,128198,you don't know what's happening in their lives 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP50.wav,283502,and i realised that actuallyi couldn't change what was happening to me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP112.wav,200154,i say yes too much and to be fair i need to say no a little bit more 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP223.wav,328986,so it's knowing that the body is just a shell for the good stuff that's inside 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP169.wav,127302,great that lady is nodding fantastic 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP63.wav,73438,this makes me happy 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP159.wav,65342,don't grow up 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP21.wav,145194,and they took me for brain scans 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP113.wav,105006,because i don't sleep ever 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP199.wav,186014,mine is slightly narcissisticbecause it's parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP98.wav,232418,because that does not lead to happiness on anyone's anyone's time 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP221.wav,59058,people know who i am 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP96.wav,96282,but it's the first time they're hearing it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP1.wav,140494,hi everyone i'm emma 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP119.wav,152390,you knowthe guy that pushes past you on the train 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP125.wav,280734,i suddenly realized as someone in londonit's an incredibly fastpaced place 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP64.wav,268886,so i'm going to share with you my ten ways to find happiness when it really doesn't want to be found 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP39.wav,172846,and i thought greatthat's the level we're going for 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP206.wav,254066,it's made me realise there are other causes out there that i could lend myself to 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP230.wav,122006,that is what i was given to start with 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP201.wav,154646,i should have other causes that i look up to as well 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP31.wav,223554,it was the day where i knew how to move forward and how to proceed with things 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP22.wav,139378,it's kind of risky territory 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP18.wav,284130,and it was eventually that my dad said to me go to the doctors get it sorted 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP34.wav,219338,we just thought we're herelet's do something fun 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP110.wav,191642,live as if it's the last opportunity you gonna haveto do something 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP8.wav,68270,it's very subtle 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP52.wav,144266,and that is something that is a massive deal 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP126.wav,278362,everyone's rushing to get somewhere and do something and pushing other people out of the way 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP15.wav,265670,and i'd had a strange feeling in my right arm for a long time 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP59.wav,137846,so i'm still dealing with the same thing 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP229.wav,133474,that is not a different package 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP220.wav,159014,and i have the opportunity that i can tell my story 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP203.wav,254310,now i fight for my own lifemy own existenceand what i want to do in my life 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP192.wav,292246,it's great to know that you can go into a room and feel confidentand present yourself confidently 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP132.wav,74498,wear flat shoes 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP33.wav,216794,we went on a fun family day out that daybecause we were all together 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP74.wav,94538,but happiness comes from within 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP55.wav,114754,and you're not going to win 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP142.wav,133778,i feel sorry that they have to wear heels all the time 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP117.wav,315642,it might be something tiny to youbut it might be something massive to them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP214.wav,531110,and finally my point is i stand in front of you as someone who physically looks nervous looks scared 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP173.wav,257798,you realise that actually you can't be ashamed of yourself anymore 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP146.wav,129190,i like to say this sentence to myself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP97.wav,265646,be impatientwith yourself not with other people 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP144.wav,60206,no one 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP30.wav,417666,but it was actually a day that for me was a day of decisivenessnot a day of sadness 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP57.wav,87658,i work in branding 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP231.wav,104366,i was given parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP148.wav,240258,but i found my port in a storm before the winds came 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP184.wav,165574,but really appreciate the small stuff that you can do 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP183.wav,100158,don't sweat the small stuff 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP147.wav,270402,because i think i've been very very lucky in the people that i have around me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP23.wav,267766,but i'm still thinkingprobably a trapped nerveor a carpal tunnel at worst 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP81.wav,147246,never bring a prop on stage when you have parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP60.wav,279042,but i'm dealing with it in a way that leads me to positivity and happiness ultimately 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP232.wav,188206,i haven't changed that in any way there's no way i can change that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP167.wav,112874,i feel i'm the only one doing that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP127.wav,225878,and it's nice to take the time to consider what other people are feeling 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP155.wav,97234,they might hold a grudge 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP104.wav,179818,and that is because i feel like i have nothing to lose 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP224.wav,169670,the brain and heart is where the important stuff happens 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP165.wav,155094,people don't laugh at silly things enough 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP38.wav,341686,one of my juniors at work sent me a text sayingtrust you to get an old person's disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP131.wav,102526,but it comes back to you eventually 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP106.wav,76974,i'll get parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP237.wav,287122,and i would just implore you to look at your own situation see what you can do to make yourself happy 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP212.wav,132694,we have a mouth we have arms 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP79.wav,130562,and that comes back to you sevenfold 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP118.wav,198082,and actually by being kind to other people and realizing that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP27.wav,264470,because the other ones you die fromand i wasn't ready to die 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP102.wav,97994,because it's a big thing to deal with 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP107.wav,69002,done that you know 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP32.wav,194098,it was also a day that i had my family around me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP181.wav,152878,because he's the man that likes colour 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP150.wav,257382,and that meant that when i looked for them they were there 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP198.wav,340306,find something that is your causeof what you want to stand up for in lifeand stand up for it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP191.wav,198550,because it's all kind of or i'm frisking them or something 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP94.wav,248522,because every time i tell someone i have parkinson'si know it breaks their heart a little bit 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP139.wav,244758,you can wear them to clubs and get away with murderit's fantastic 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP140.wav,180658,but some people trot around town all the time in heels 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP190.wav,190382,you know i hug someone now and it feels like i'm about to attack them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP207.wav,111334,and i could do more for them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP100.wav,399106,i could have very easily hidden in a cornerwith slippers on on a chairdone nothing for the rest of my life 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP20.wav,101734,and i did 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP152.wav,161766,sometimes if you think people are going to be there 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP239.wav,112986,and ultimately it's in our hands 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP58.wav,351678,i can repackage this and actually make it something that works for me and that i enjoy 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP88.wav,271026,and being honestand by actually being someone that has to go out and talk about parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP133.wav,80906,i cannot stress this enough 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP188.wav,66186,if you possibly can 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP153.wav,206118,you're not a hundred percent sure until you actually need them whether they are 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP160.wav,122210,i don't mean like die or anything 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP71.wav,196538,i've looked for it in the bottom of the scrolling page on asos 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP168.wav,172974,i'm hoping other people here do that every time as well 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP176.wav,153498,but i think children have it right 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP101.wav,120302,then everyone probably would never judge me for it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP174.wav,295298,you have to come and just get on with being yourself and doing what you do 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP49.wav,413622,i've got to find out what to do with it to make my life goodand make my life strongand to make decisions for myself 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP218.wav,172834,but if you look into my eyes and you hear me speak 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP54.wav,120258,you're fighting a battle against your brain 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP10.wav,170734,i wasn't expecting parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP122.wav,94142,you stood there tutting at them 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP83.wav,159054,it's okay to not be okay you know 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP53.wav,809902,if anyone knows anything about parkinson'sparkinson's cause is a lack of dopaminea chemical which controls temperaturemood your movementsthe way your brain communicates with every single muscle in your body 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP72.wav,87922,you know i've looked everywhere for it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP12.wav,77690,no one is 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP202.wav,257786,but actually before i was diagnosedi didn't really fight for anything 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP134.wav,169262,if you have unhappy feetyou have an unhappy mind 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP51.wav,153334,i had a lack of dopamine in my system 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP37.wav,192086,and every text i goti got more and more positive in return 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP16.wav,170870,something that i couldn't pin down to anything in particular 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP225.wav,106602,that's the magic 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP161.wav,66746,we're not going to get that dark 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP78.wav,147298,then you promote happiness to other people 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP62.wav,96838,some is through what i'm wearing 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP135.wav,98526,i've got a slight heel on today 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP89.wav,295614,if i'm selling it as something that is amazingand it's all about tinsel tops and things like that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP67.wav,153394,ultimately if you go searching for it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP193.wav,173538,and having something like parkinson's stops that from happening 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP205.wav,163430,i'm a kind of mouthpiece for those people as well 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP92.wav,220458,they know what i expect from them what i do and don't want help with 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP197.wav,229362,because i can still do it and screw it i'm going to it for as long as i can 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP17.wav,85378,and i'd been ignoring it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP171.wav,142010,wearing tops like this when you're supposed to be a grownup 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP45.wav,113326,that is a positive one 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP195.wav,212074,so the tiny things that i'm left withthat i know i can still do 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP175.wav,96882,and it's incredibly freeing 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/emma/emma_au/WP1111/WP56.wav,156458,but i thought i can repackage this
