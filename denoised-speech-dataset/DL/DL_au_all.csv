/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL18.wav,239820,and you're not quite sure what it means 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL56.wav,669088,but i'm not going to regret walking away from this career if i have to 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL30.wav,426412,one of the things i've had to do is adjust my driving 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL7.wav,303004,it's an old person's disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL60.wav,391240,so i'm just working out what's next for me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL34.wav,577788,it just wasn't doing it in a timely manner shall we say 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL50.wav,354396,if i step away from this it will just be the right time for the right reasons 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL6.wav,394156,it's a merciless disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL8.wav,274032,people get it at sixtyfive 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL10.wav,736872,and you know it is evolved into the deep and rich understanding 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL49.wav,328564,because it keeps me very mentally alive 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL35.wav,526448,so what i've done is i use my left foot on the brake and my right foot on the accelerator 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL38.wav,387844,so it's my right side that is the weaker of the two 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL1.wav,576036,i kind of knew something was wrong but could not put my finger on it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL51.wav,543488,it's very rewarding working with clients and helping them establish their values and their vision 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL59.wav,493436,we aren't growing the business at a rate that i feel is acceptable 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL25.wav,440016,so she was asking some tough questions i think 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL65.wav,278296,it's an ever moving conversation 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL53.wav,192044,and that's in my bank 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL64.wav,313420,i might be holding him back so we're just talking about that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL9.wav,693352,what we have underlying us if we didn't already have it before is a really profound friendship 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL2.wav,464040,so many things were out of kilter and out of balance and out of whack 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL22.wav,318972,and kate and i were fairly new into a relationship 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL28.wav,302052,it's an eternal 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL29.wav,198904,its an eternal you're always wrestling with itso you've got to just be with that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL17.wav,256044,it's one of those big moments in your life 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL23.wav,215940,we just had our first baby 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL3.wav,384040,parkinson's creeps up on you incrementally 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL41.wav,392120,when people see me they just go something's not right 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL37.wav,461840,and now i've made the transition and the neural pathways have realigned themselves 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL55.wav,212108,and i've got some ideas about that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL54.wav,401256,if i don't do that going forward it doesn't matter because i'll be doing something else 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL32.wav,734604,and i was having trouble with my right leg transferring it from the accelerator to the break 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL58.wav,316344,i don't have a lot of proactive energy 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL19.wav,372628,what was going on was that i had full blown parkinson's running through my system 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL36.wav,263204,hopefully not at the same time 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL61.wav,460436,because you know stress and fatigue aren't good for me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL27.wav,414964,and i'll cycle through that all the time 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL46.wav,496080,it won't affect anything i do and i'm not drunk or mad 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL26.wav,410808,i go from being at peace to being very angry 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL39.wav,209144,ok you have a lovely day 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL4.wav,506700,there's a lot of pain in a person's with parkinson's body 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL31.wav,233692,you can see my hand shakes 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL43.wav,336936,i'm in a place where i can't really hide it so i don't 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL21.wav,293628,and you know the wheels were falling off 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL52.wav,326024,and then evolving their marketing and their brand 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL42.wav,441852,so if i don't deal with that quickly then they start filling in the gaps 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/DL_au/DL16.wav,294036,the diagnosis was a massive shock
