/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC18.wav,215932,you know i was reading about it and 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC3.wav,230428,my husband saw me running and he said 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC7.wav,189576,we were on vacation 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC2.wav,320296,like my right leg just didn't keep up with the left leg 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC14.wav,218352,i have this galloping gait 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC15.wav,250676,i've fallen a couple times 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC4.wav,215432,what's wrong with you then 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC9.wav,451408,well i think what happened is i felt like i had to do everything now 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC16.wav,306988,so this will be my last marathon 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC5.wav,207160,like i had a stroke 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC20.wav,185520,it's really very exciting 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC11.wav,274968,just cuz i want to get it all in 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC8.wav,291592,so when we get back i finally went to the doctor 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC17.wav,312072,i mean i really know nothing about a foundation till i got diagnosed and then 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC12.wav,251412,training is not going well 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC6.wav,186992,no i didn't 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/JC_au/JC19.wav,455168,you know i just really like the the work you're doing with the base search and working with the collaboration 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ21.wav,299844,we've resolved to fight this disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ6.wav,358368,it's the little things like putting a cup on a saucer 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ14.wav,281184,it's not as just a pure scientific thing 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ4.wav,307612,so how was the reaction of your family 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ2.wav,519000,i soon learned that each patient has their own version of parkinson's their own story to tell 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ20.wav,500344,we face parkinson's headon with purpose reexamined and new dreams to pursue 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ9.wav,414456,so much of what you do is precise and about balance 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ22.wav,323620,we may each have our own individual parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ16.wav,248048,acceptance doesn't mean resignation 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ8.wav,273224,and you you dream on your way 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ15.wav,272312,you're in the pharmaceutical business 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ23.wav,467884,but we all share one thing in common hope 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ11.wav,260724,it seems like it confers all that out of the window 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ19.wav,311756,the cure may seem elusive but we're not giving up 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ13.wav,300380,if you're symptomatic it's reflective of some kind of flaw 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ17.wav,364348,you can accept it and then endeavor to change it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ18.wav,382704,there are over one million people living with parkinson's in the united states 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ1.wav,353288,i was twenty nine when i found out i had parkinson's disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ7.wav,203540,it destroyed me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/MJ_au/MJ12.wav,380904,when she get past the idea that you did something to deserve this or that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK4.wav,209380,why me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK1.wav,361872,i was diagnosed in two thousand and six 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK17.wav,453268,and i'm glad it's it's on your path 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK6.wav,529696,after you would come out with an article about going public with it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK9.wav,407284,and because i was the swimmer of the family 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK2.wav,285636,it was two weeks after my thirty ninth birthday 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK13.wav,339492,i was given this and i was given it for a reason 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK8.wav,508276,this was the first out of eight siblings that had really asked me about it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK10.wav,301040,i was went to college on a scholarship 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK7.wav,289412,my sister started asking me questions 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK16.wav,274048,i truly think i do have a mission 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK14.wav,553276,and i can either sit and sulk and be a victim or take this and run with it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK11.wav,542040,and i just felt with my family that i was the loser with a disease 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK12.wav,426328,i guess it took me a few years to say okay 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK5.wav,359544,in our family we always swept things under the rug 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK3.wav,367052,that just came across me like where did this come from 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/SK_au/SK15.wav,418836,if there's a possible cure i will do whatever i can for it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TP_au/TP6.wav,235268,and the answers are elusive 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TP_au/TP3.wav,309812,and sooner or later there wouldn't the hand wouldn't move 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TP_au/TP1.wav,348812,i was writing thank you notes to people for my fiftieth birthday party 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TP_au/TP2.wav,359664,and i would start to note the letters would get smaller and smaller 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TP_au/TP4.wav,322752,so i said it's definitely something going on here 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TP_au/TP5.wav,440388,i was soaked through hard work and perseverance that we would get the answers 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG41.wav,290848,i can do this alone and now i know that i can't 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG6.wav,237648,it's the only thing i knew about it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG15.wav,248192,i mean you don't get to decide it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG36.wav,327676,i don't need to be in the nba i don't need to be that player 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG4.wav,419164,and i remember when you came out and told the world that you had parkinson's 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG8.wav,273328,so i i kept it to myself in my first year 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG33.wav,284908,i you know my mind plays tricks on me sometimes 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG23.wav,285772,if there's something that you can't fix 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG30.wav,287320,but sometimes i think i don't have it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG1.wav,280016,i had a really strong hand tremor 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG35.wav,245716,i finally let the nba go 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG32.wav,384044,this you know even though it's tremoring or maybe it's something else 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG11.wav,445324,and i didn't directly tell her what the story was 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG21.wav,222916,you know that you can recover from it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG37.wav,280412,i'm brian grant i'm not brian the player you know 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG25.wav,419628,because i really missed out on being able to spend some good time with these guys over the past few years 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG28.wav,478028,for me for me it has it just it all at once to come and say okay i accepted 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG12.wav,289180,the number one thing that the doctors tell you is don't stress out 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG39.wav,432864,and that's what i've learned to do is to let people come and help with before i was all about me 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG13.wav,230760,how can you tell me not to stress out 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG16.wav,359196,the moment you you know have parkinson's whether you're going through family issues 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG3.wav,221792,and finally i was diagnosed 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG5.wav,347920,i just thought it was just a disease that made you shake 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG10.wav,251084,in your mind you tend to think that you're weak 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG27.wav,325380,because i didn't want the young guy seeing my hand shake 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG9.wav,331408,and i dropped hints and i brought up alerts 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG24.wav,200788,and i had to lose that 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG14.wav,236116,you know that that's impossible 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG40.wav,217476,and i can fix it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG31.wav,248092,sometimes i convinced myself didn't man 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG18.wav,228608,i had depression 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG22.wav,254112,you'll be alright you'll be back on the court 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG19.wav,309252,and then i had and you know a marriage 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG42.wav,300032,and i know that i do have to let these people come and help 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG20.wav,334516,when you're playing and you have injuries you know that you can recover from it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG26.wav,261488,because i was too nervous to go into a locker room 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG7.wav,478496,well i prepared my wife first and wanted her to become comfortable with it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/BG_au/BG29.wav,248312,i don't know if this happened with you 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS3.wav,428344,but then it came to a point where the thing that stops it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS11.wav,396304,yeah there's no escaping and 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS5.wav,370400,it doesn't stop except it you know when you're sleeping 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS14.wav,448412,it's so amazing you know to be able to get people the tools 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS9.wav,390560,and now it's like it's rather hard to keep that flowing 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS12.wav,263312,you have to accept it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS2.wav,577288,and i started off just kind of noticing a kind of a kink in my arm before i could just stop it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS10.wav,291768,and it's kind of discouraging 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS6.wav,308080,i wish we could somehow sleepwalk 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS1.wav,630864,i had noticed um a few years prior that i wasn't smelling things as clearly 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS8.wav,301596,because there's certain details you want to draw on 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS4.wav,229376,it wasn't there anymore 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS15.wav,491548,and the financing to use their minds to to zero in on the problem 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS13.wav,444200,you know what you're doing is just like that it's the it's so hero 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_au/TS_au/TS7.wav,437076,it gets rough like the drawing is is particular
