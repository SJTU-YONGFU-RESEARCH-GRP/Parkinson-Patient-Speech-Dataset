/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS3.wav,428344,but then it came to a point where the thing that stops it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS11.wav,396304,yeah there's no escaping and 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS5.wav,370400,it doesn't stop except it you know when you're sleeping 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS14.wav,448412,it's so amazing you know to be able to get people the tools 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS9.wav,390560,and now it's like it's rather hard to keep that flowing 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS12.wav,263312,you have to accept it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS2.wav,577288,and i started off just kind of noticing a kind of a kink in my arm before i could just stop it 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS10.wav,291768,and it's kind of discouraging 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS6.wav,308080,i wish we could somehow sleepwalk 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS1.wav,630864,i had noticed um a few years prior that i wasn't smelling things as clearly 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS8.wav,301596,because there's certain details you want to draw on 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS4.wav,229376,it wasn't there anymore 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS15.wav,491548,and the financing to use their minds to to zero in on the problem 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS13.wav,444200,you know what you're doing is just like that it's the it's so hero 
/home/longisland/Documents/stt/DeepSpeech/data/Faces_ori/TS_ori/TS7.wav,437076,it gets rough like the drawing is is particular
